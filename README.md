# Configuration
To get started, do `npm install` in the root project folder.

Navigate to `/ios` and perform a `pod install` to install the podfiles used for `react-native-maps`.

Finally, to run the project in the iOS simulator, do
```
$ react-native run-ios
```

and the project should be up and running.
